# Assignment

Build application to show characters from “a Game ofThrones”.Your mission is to show characters from “a Game of Thrones” in a table with severalfunctionalities.
The api to be used is from [https://anapioficeandfire.com/]. Documentation about the API isavailable there as well.

In the application we want to see the following functionalities:

- Pagination (max 10 on a page)
- Filtering on different columns (text filter on the table)
- Sort ordering on different columns

Bonus:
- Try to minimize requests sent to the api. (back button not fetching data again)
- We want to get an idea about the age of the character. The current api does not havethis data available. You could guess this on first name by using [https://agify.io] api.
- Use a CSS framework of you choice to style your componentsBuild this application with React or Vue, whatever your preference is.Make sure the application is production ready and well documented.
